Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. (Not to be confused with a WordPress framework - [Redux Framewrok](https://reduxframework.com/).)  

It helps you wirte applications that behave consistenly, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).
